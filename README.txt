PuTTY README
============

This is the README file for the PuTTY installer distribution. If
you're reading this, you've probably just run our installer and
installed PuTTY on your system.

What should I do next?
----------------------

If you want to use PuTTY to connect to other computers, or use PSFTP
to transfer files, you should just be able to run them from the
Start menu.

If you want to use the command-line-only file transfer utility PSCP,
you will probably want to put the PuTTY installation directory to be
on your PATH. How you do this depends on your version of Windows. On
Windows NT and 2000, you can set it using Control Panel > System; on
Windows 95 you will need to edit AUTOEXEC.BAT. Consult your Windows
manuals for details.

What do I do if it doesn't work?
