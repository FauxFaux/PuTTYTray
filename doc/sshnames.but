\A{sshnames} SSH-2 names specified for PuTTY

There are various parts of the SSH-2 protocol where things are specified
using a textual name.  Names ending in \cw{@putty.projects.tartarus.org}
are reserved for allocation by the PuTTY team.  Allocated names are
documented here.

\H{sshnames-channel} Connection protocol channel request names

These names can be sent in a \cw{SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST} message.

\dt \cw{simple@putty.projects.tartarus.org}

\dd This is sent by a client to announce that it will not have more than
one channel open at a time in the current connection (that one being
the one the request is sent on).  The intention is that the server,
knowing this, can set the window on that one channel to something very
large, and leave flow control to TCP.  There is no message-specific data.

\dt \cw{winadj@putty.projects.tartarus.org}

\dd PuTTY sends this request along with some
\cw{SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_WINDOW_ADJUST} messages as part of its window-size
tuning.  It can be sent on any type of channel.  There is no
message-specific data. Servers MUST treat it as an unrecognised request
and respond with \cw{SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE}.

\lcont{
(Some SSH servers get confused by this message, so there is a
bug-compatibility mode for disabling it. See \k{config-ssh-bug-winadj}.)
}

\H{sshnames-kex} Key exchange method names

\dt \cw{rsa-sha1-draft-00@putty.projects.tartarus.org}

\dd These appeared in various drafts of what eventually became RFC\_4432.
They have been superseded by \cw{rsa1024-sha1} and \cw{rsa2048-sha256}.

\H{sshnames-encrypt} Encryption algorithm names

\dt \cw{arcfour128-draft-00@putty.projects.tartarus.org}

\dt \cw{arcfour256-draft-00@putty.projects.tartarus.org}

\dd These were used in drafts of what eventually became RFC\_4345.
They have been superseded by \cw{arcfour128} and \cw{arcfour256}.
