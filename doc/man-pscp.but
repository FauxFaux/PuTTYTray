\S{pscp-manpage-description} DESCRIPTION

\cw{pscp} is a command-line client for the SSH-based SCP (secure
copy) and SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) protocols.

\S{pscp-manpage-options} OPTIONS

The command-line options supported by \e{pscp} are:

\dt \cw{-V}

\dd Show version information and exit.

\dt \cw{-pgpfp}

\dd Display the fingerprints of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys and exit,
to aid in verifying new files released by the PuTTY team.

\dt \cw{-ls}

\dd Remote directory listing.

\dt \cw{-p}

\dd Preserve file attributes.

\dt \cw{-q}

\dd Quiet, don't show statistics.

\dt \cw{-r}

\dd Copy directories recursively.

\dt \cw{-unsafe}

\dd Allow server-side wildcards (DANGEROUS).

\dt \cw{-v}

\dd Show verbose messages.

\dt \cw{-load} \e{session}

\dd Load settings from saved session.

\dt \cw{-P} \e{port}

\dd Connect to port \e{port}.

\dt \cw{-l} \e{user}

\dd Set remote username to \e{user}.

\dt \cw{-batch}

\dd Disable interactive prompts.

\dt \cw{-pw} \e{password}

\dd Set remote password to \e{password}. \e{CAUTION:} this will likely
make the password visible to other users of the local machine (via
commands such as \q{\c{w}}).

\dt \cw{-1}

\dd Force use of SSH protocol version 1.

\dt \cw{-2}

\dd Force use of SSH protocol version 2.

\dt \cw{-C}

\dd Enable SSH compression.

\dt \cw{-i} \e{path}

\dd Private key file for user authentication.

\dt \cw{\-hostkey} \e{key}

\dd Specify an acceptable host public key. This option may be specified
multiple times; each key can be either a fingerprint (\cw{99:aa:bb:...}) or
a base64-encoded blob in OpenSSH's one-line format.

\lcont{ Specifying this option overrides automated host key
management; \e{only} the key(s) specified on the command-line will be
accepted (unless a saved session also overrides host keys, in which
case those will be added to), and the host key cache will not be
written. }

\dt \cw{-scp}

\dd Force use of SCP protocol.

\dt \cw{-sftp}

\dd Force use of SFTP protocol.

\dt \cw{\-sshlog} \e{logfile}

\dt \cw{\-sshrawlog} \e{logfile}

\dd These options make \cw{pscp} log protocol details to a file.
(Some of these may be sensitive, although by default an effort is made
to suppress obvious passwords.)

\lcont{
\cw{\-sshlog} logs decoded SSH packets and other events (those that
\cw{\-v} would print). \cw{\-sshrawlog} additionally logs the raw
encrypted packet data.
}
