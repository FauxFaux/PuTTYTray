\S{putty-manpage-name} NAME

\cw{putty} - GUI SSH, Telnet and Rlogin client for X

\S{putty-manpage-synopsis} SYNOPSIS

\c putty [ options ] [ host ]
\e bbbbb   iiiiiii     iiii

\S{putty-manpage-description} DESCRIPTION

\cw{putty} is a graphical SSH, Telnet and Rlogin client for X. It is
a direct port of the Windows SSH client of the same name.

\S{putty-manpage-options} OPTIONS

The command-line options supported by \cw{putty} are:

\dt \cw{\-\-display} \e{display\-name}

\dd Specify the X display on which to open \cw{putty}. (Note this
option has a double minus sign, even though none of the others do.
This is because this option is supplied automatically by GTK.
Sorry.)

\dt \cw{\-fn} \e{font-name}

\dd Specify the font to use for normal text displayed in the terminal.

\dt \cw{\-fb} \e{font-name}

\dd Specify the font to use for bold text displayed in the terminal.
If the \cw{BoldAsColour} resource is set to 1 (the default), bold
text will be displayed in different colours instead of a different
font, so this option will be ignored. If \cw{BoldAsColour} is set to
0 or 2 and you do not specify a bold font, \cw{putty} will overprint the
normal font to make it look bolder.

\dt \cw{\-fw} \e{font-name}

\dd Specify the font to use for double-width characters (typically
Chinese, Japanese and Korean text) displayed in the terminal.

\dt \cw{\-fwb} \e{font-name}

\dd Specify the font to use for bold double-width characters
(typically Chinese, Japanese and Korean text). Like \cw{-fb}, this
will be ignored unless the \cw{BoldAsColour} resource is set to 0 or 2.

\dt \cw{\-geometry} \e{geometry}

\dd Specify the size of the terminal, in rows and columns of text.
See \e{X(7)} for more information on the syntax of geometry
specifications.

\dt \cw{\-sl} \e{lines}

\dd Specify the number of lines of scrollback to save off the top of the
terminal.

\dt \cw{\-fg} \e{colour}

\dd Specify the foreground colour to use for normal text.

\dt \cw{\-bg} \e{colour}

\dd Specify the background colour to use for normal text.

\dt \cw{\-bfg} \e{colour}

\dd Specify the foreground colour to use for bold text, if the
\cw{BoldAsColour} resource is set to 1 (the default) or 2.

\dt \cw{\-bbg} \e{colour}

\dd Specify the foreground colour to use for bold reverse-video
text, if the \cw{BoldAsColour} resource is set to 1 (the default) or 2.
(This colour is best thought of as the bold version of the
background colour; so it only appears when text is displayed \e{in}
the background colour.)

\dt \cw{\-cfg} \e{colour}

\dd Specify the foreground colour to use for text covered by the cursor.

\dt \cw{\-cbg} \e{colour}

\dd Specify the background colour to use for text covered by the cursor.
In other words, this is the main colour of the cursor.

\dt \cw{\-title} \e{title}

\dd Specify the initial title of the terminal window. (This can be
changed under control of the server.)

\dt \cw{\-sb\-} or \cw{+sb}

\dd Tells \cw{putty} not to display a scroll bar.

\dt \cw{\-sb}

\dd Tells \cw{putty} to display a scroll bar: this is the opposite of
\cw{\-sb\-}. This is the default option: you will probably only need
to specify it explicitly if you have changed the default using the
\cw{ScrollBar} resource.

\dt \cw{\-log} \e{filename}

\dd This option makes \cw{putty} log all the terminal output to a file
as well as displaying it in the terminal.


\dt \cw{\-cs} \e{charset}

\dd This option specifies the character set in which \cw{putty}
should assume the session is operating. This character set will be
used to interpret all the data received from the session, and all
input you type or paste into \cw{putty} will be converted into
this character set before being sent to the session.

\lcont{ Any character set name which is valid in a MIME header (and
supported by \cw{putty}) should be valid here (examples are
\q{\cw{ISO-8859-1}}, \q{\cw{windows-1252}} or \q{\cw{UTF-8}}). Also,
any character encoding which is valid in an X logical font
description should be valid (\q{\cw{ibm-cp437}}, for example).

\cw{putty}'s default behaviour is to use the same character
encoding as its primary font. If you supply a Unicode
(\cw{iso10646-1}) font, it will default to the UTF-8 character set.

Character set names are case-insensitive.
}

\dt \cw{\-nethack}

\dd Tells \cw{putty} to enable NetHack keypad mode, in which the
numeric keypad generates the NetHack \c{hjklyubn} direction keys.
This enables you to play NetHack with the numeric keypad without
having to use the NetHack \c{number_pad} option (which requires you
to press \q{\cw{n}} before any repeat count). So you can move with
the numeric keypad, and enter repeat counts with the normal number
keys.

\dt \cw{\-help}, \cw{\-\-help}

\dd Display a message summarizing the available options.

\dt \cw{\-pgpfp}

\dd Display the fingerprints of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys, to aid
in verifying new files released by the PuTTY team.

\dt \cw{\-load} \e{session}

\dd Load a saved session by name. This allows you to run a saved session
straight from the command line without having to go through the
configuration box first.

\dt \cw{\-ssh}, \cw{\-telnet}, \cw{\-rlogin}, \cw{\-raw}, \cw{\-serial}

\dd Select the protocol \cw{putty} will use to make the connection.

\dt \cw{\-l} \e{username}

\dd Specify the username to use when logging in to the server.

\dt \cw{\-L} \cw{[}\e{srcaddr}\cw{:]}\e{srcport}\cw{:}\e{desthost}\cw{:}\e{destport}

\dd Set up a local port forwarding: listen on \e{srcport} (or
\e{srcaddr}:\e{srcport} if specified), and forward any connections
over the SSH connection to the destination address
\e{desthost}:\e{destport}. Only works in SSH.

\dt \cw{\-R} \cw{[}\e{srcaddr}\cw{:]}\e{srcport}\cw{:}\e{desthost}\cw{:}\e{destport}

\dd Set up a remote port forwarding: ask the SSH server to listen on
\e{srcport} (or \e{srcaddr}:\e{srcport} if specified), and to
forward any connections back over the SSH connection where the
client will pass them on to the destination address
\e{desthost}:\e{destport}. Only works in SSH.

\dt \cw{\-D} [\e{srcaddr}:]\e{srcport}

\dd Set up dynamic port forwarding. The client listens on
\e{srcport} (or \e{srcaddr}:\e{srcport} if specified), and
implements a SOCKS server. So you can point SOCKS-aware applications
at this port and they will automatically use the SSH connection to
tunnel all their connections. Only works in SSH.

\dt \cw{\-P} \e{port}

\dd Specify the port to connect to the server on.

\dt \cw{\-A}, \cw{\-a}

\dd Enable (\cw{\-A}) or disable (\cw{\-a}) SSH agent forwarding.
Currently this only works with OpenSSH and SSH-1.

\dt \cw{\-X}, \cw{\-x}

\dd Enable (\cw{\-X}) or disable (\cw{\-x}) X11 forwarding.

\dt \cw{\-T}, \cw{\-t}

\dd Enable (\cw{\-t}) or disable (\cw{\-T}) the allocation of a
pseudo-terminal at the server end.

\dt \cw{\-C}

\dd Enable zlib-style compression on the connection.

\dt \cw{\-1}, \cw{\-2}

\dd Select SSH protocol version 1 or 2.

\dt \cw{\-i} \e{keyfile}

\dd Specify a private key file to use for user authentication. For SSH-2
keys, this key file must be in PuTTY's format, not OpenSSH's or
anyone else's.

\dt \cw{\-hostkey} \e{key}

\dd Specify an acceptable host public key. This option may be specified
multiple times; each key can be either a fingerprint (\cw{99:aa:bb:...}) or
a base64-encoded blob in OpenSSH's one-line format.

\lcont{ Specifying this option overrides automated host key
management; \e{only} the key(s) specified on the command-line will be
accepted (unless a saved session also overrides host keys, in which
case those will be added to), and the host key cache will not be
written. }

\dt \cw{\-sercfg} \e{configuration-string}

\dd Specify the configuration parameters for the serial port, in
\cw{-serial} mode. \e{configuration-string} should be a
comma-separated list of configuration parameters as follows:

\lcont{

\b Any single digit from 5 to 9 sets the number of data bits.

\b \cq{1}, \cq{1.5} or \cq{2} sets the number of stop bits.

\b Any other numeric string is interpreted as a baud rate.

\b A single lower-case letter specifies the parity: \cq{n} for none,
\cq{o} for odd, \cq{e} for even, \cq{m} for mark and \cq{s} for space.

\b A single upper-case letter specifies the flow control: \cq{N} for
none, \cq{X} for XON/XOFF, \cq{R} for RTS/CTS and \cq{D} for
DSR/DTR.
