PuTTY is a free (MIT-licensed) Win32 Telnet and SSH client. This
manual documents PuTTY, and its companion utilities PSCP, PSFTP,
Plink, Pageant and PuTTYgen.

\e{Note to Unix users:} this manual currently primarily documents the
Windows versions of the PuTTY utilities. Some options are therefore
mentioned that are absent from the \i{Unix version}; the Unix version has
features not described here; and the \i\cw{pterm} and command-line
\cw{puttygen} utilities are not described at all. The only
Unix-specific documentation that currently exists is the
\I{man pages for PuTTY tools}man pages.
