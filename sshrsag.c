   * Set up the phase limits for the progress report. We do this

   * For prime generation: our initial filter finds things
   * coprime to everything below 2^16. Computing the product of
   * (p-1)/p for all prime p below 2^16 gives about 20.33; so
   * among B-bit integers, one in every 20.33 will get through
   * the initial filter to be a candidate prime.
   *
   * Meanwhile, we are searching for primes in the region of 2^B;
   * since pi(x) ~ x/log(x), when x is in the region of 2^B, the
   * prime density will be d/dx pi(x) ~ 1/log(B), i.e. about
   * 1/0.6931B. So the chance of any given candidate being prime
   * is 20.33/0.6931B, which is roughly 29.34 divided by B.
   *
   * So now we have this probability P, we're looking at an
   * exponential distribution with parameter P: we will manage in
   * one attempt with probability P, in two with probability
   * P(1-P), in three with probability P(1-P)^2, etc. The
   * probability that we have still not managed to find a prime
   * after N attempts is (1-P)^N.
   *
   * We therefore inform the progress indicator of the number B
   * (29.34/B), so that it knows how much to increment by each
   * time. We do this in 16-bit fixed point, so 29.34 becomes
   * 0x1D.57C4.
