PuTTY README
============

This is the README file for the PuTTY installer distribution. If
you're reading this, you've probably just run our installer and
installed PuTTY on your system.

What should I do next?
----------------------

If you want to use PuTTY to connect to other computers, or use PSFTP
to transfer files, you should just be able to run them from the
Start menu.

If you want to use the command-line-only file transfer utility PSCP,
you will probably want to put the PuTTY installation directory on
your PATH. How you do this depends on your version of Windows. On
Windows NT, 2000, and XP, you can set it using Control Panel > System;
on Windows 95, 98, and Me, you will need to edit AUTOEXEC.BAT. Consult
your Windows manuals for details.

Some versions of Windows will refuse to run HTML Help files (.CHM)
if they are installed on a network drive. If you have installed
PuTTY on a network drive, you might want to check that the help file
works properly. If not, see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896054
for information on how to solve this problem.

What do I do if it doesn't work?
