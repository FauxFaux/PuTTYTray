/*
 * Windows resources shared between PuTTY and PuTTYtel, to be #include'd
 * after defining appropriate macros.
 * Note that many of these strings mention PuTTY. Due to restrictions in
 * VC's handling of string concatenation, this can't easily be fixed.
 * It's fixed up at runtime.
 * FIXME: This file is called '.rc2' rather than '.rc' to avoid MSVC trying
 * to compile it on its own when using the project files. Nicer solutions
 * welcome.
