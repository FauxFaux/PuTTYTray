; -- Inno Setup installer script for PuTTY and its related tools.
;    Last tested with Inno Setup 5.0.8.
;
; TODO for future releases:
;
;  - It might be nice to have an option to add PSCP, Plink and PSFTP to
;    the PATH. See wish `installer-addpath'.
;
;  - Maybe a "custom" installation might be useful? Hassle with
;    UninstallDisplayIcon, though.

[Files]
; We flag all files with "restartreplace" et al primarily for the benefit
; of unattended un/installations/upgrades, when the user is running one
; of the apps at a time. Without it, the operation will fail noisily in
; this situation.
; This does mean that the user will be prompted to restart their machine
; if any of the files _were_ open during installation (or, if /VERYSILENT
; is used, the machine will be restarted automatically!). The /NORESTART
; flag avoids this.
; It might be nicer to have a "no worries, replace the file next time you
; reboot" option, but the developers have no interest in adding one.
; NB: apparently, using long (non-8.3) filenames with restartreplace is a
; bad idea. (Not that we do.)

[Messages]
; Since it's possible for the user to be asked to restart their computer,
; we should override the default messages to explain exactly why, so they
; can make an informed decision. (Especially as 95% of users won't need or
; want to restart; see rant above.)
