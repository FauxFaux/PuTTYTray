; -- Legacy Inno Setup installer script for PuTTY and its related tools.
;    Last tested with Inno Setup 5.5.9.
;    (New work should go to the MSI installer; see installer.wxs.)
;
; TODO for future releases:
;
;  - It might be nice to have an option to add PSCP, Plink and PSFTP to
;    the PATH. See wish `installer-addpath'.
;
;  - Maybe a "custom" installation might be useful? Hassle with
;    UninstallDisplayIcon, though.

[Files]
; We flag all files with "restartreplace" et al primarily for the benefit
; of unattended un/installations/upgrades, when the user is running one
; of the apps at a time. Without it, the operation will fail noisily in
; this situation.
; This does mean that the user will be prompted to restart their machine
; if any of the files _were_ open during installation (or, if /VERYSILENT
; is used, the machine will be restarted automatically!). The /NORESTART
; flag avoids this.
; It might be nicer to have a "no worries, replace the file next time you
; reboot" option, but the developers have no interest in adding one.
; NB: apparently, using long (non-8.3) filenames with restartreplace is a
; bad idea. (Not that we do.)

[Messages]
; Since it's possible for the user to be asked to restart their computer,
; we should override the default messages to explain exactly why, so they
; can make an informed decision. (Especially as 95% of users won't need or
; want to restart; see rant above.)
FinishedRestartLabel=One or more [name] programs are still running. Setup will not replace these program files until you restart your computer. Would you like to restart now?
; This message is popped up in a message box on a /SILENT install.
FinishedRestartMessage=One or more [name] programs are still running.%nSetup will not replace these program files until you restart your computer.%n%nWould you like to restart now?
; ...and this comes up if you try to uninstall.
UninstalledAndNeedsRestart=One or more %1 programs are still running.%nThe program files will not be removed until your computer is restarted.%n%nWould you like to restart now?
; Old versions of this installer used to prompt to remove saved settings
; and the like after the point this message was printed, so it seems
; polite to warn people that that no longer happens.
ConfirmUninstall=Are you sure you want to completely remove %1 and all of its components?%n%nNote that this will not remove any saved sessions or random seed file that %1 has created. These are harmless to leave on your system, but if you want to remove them, you should answer No here and run 'putty.exe -cleanup' before you uninstall.
