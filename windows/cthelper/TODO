[done] A way to propagate fatal error messages back to PuTTYcyg to display in a message box

BUG: Duplicate session brings up dialog on cygterm terminals using the user's default shell.

BUG: When running an arbitrary command, PuTTYcyg closes one character after EOF.

Misfeature: In Cygwin ps output, the cthelper process does not show with which TTY it is associated.

Flow control stop (^S) should be more instantaneous
