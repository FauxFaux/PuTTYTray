 * return bytes from `pool', at position `poolpos', until `poolpos'
 * reaches the end of the pool. At this point we generate more
 * random data, by adding noise, stirring well, and resetting
 * `poolpos' to point to just past the beginning of the pool (not
 * _the_ beginning, since otherwise we'd give away the whole
 * contents of our pool, and attackers would just have to guess the
 * next lot of noise).
 *
 * `incomingb' buffers acquired noise data, until it gets full, at
 * which point the acquired noise is SHA'ed into `incoming' and
 * `incomingb' is cleared. The noise in `incoming' is used as part
 * of the noise for each stirring of the pool, in addition to local
 * time, process listings, and other such stuff.
