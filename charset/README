This subdirectory contains a general character-set conversion
library, used in the Unix port of PuTTY, and available for use in
other ports if it should happen to be useful.

This is a variant of a library that's currently used in some other
programs such as Timber and Halibut. At some future date, we would
like to merge the two libraries, so that all programs use the same
libcharset.

It is therefore a _strong_ design goal that this library should remain
perfectly general, and not tied to particulars of PuTTY. It must not
reference any code outside its own subdirectory; it should not have
PuTTY-specific helper routines added to it unless they can be
documented in a general manner which might make them useful in other
circumstances as well.
