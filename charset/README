This subdirectory contains a general character-set conversion
library, used in the Unix port of PuTTY, and available for use in
other ports if it should happen to be useful.

I intend to use this same library in other programs at some future
date. It is therefore a _strong_ design goal that this library
should remain perfectly general, and not tied to particulars of
PuTTY. It must not reference any code outside its own subdirectory;
it should not have PuTTY-specific helper routines added to it unless
they can be documented in a general manner which might make them
useful in other circumstances as well.
