/*

To build on OS X, you will need a build environment with GTK 3 and
gtk-mac-bundler, and also Halibut on the path (to build the man pages,
without which the standard Makefile will complain). Then, from a clean
checkout, do this:

./mkfiles.pl -U --with-quartz
make -C icons icns
make -C doc
make

and you should get unix/PuTTY.app and unix/PTerm.app as output.

TODO list for a sensible GTK3 PuTTY/pterm on OS X:

Menu items' keyboard shortcuts (Command-Q for Quit, Command-V for
Paste) do not currently work. It's intentional that if you turn on
'Command key acts as Meta' in the configuration then those shortcuts
should be superseded by the Meta-key functionality (e.g. Cmd-Q should
send ESC Q to the session), for the benefit of people whose non-Mac
keyboard reflexes expect the Meta key to be in that position; but if
you don't turn that option on, then these shortcuts should work as an
ordinary Mac user expects, and currently they don't.

Windows don't close sensibly when their sessions terminate. This is
because until now I've relied on calling cleanup_exit() or
gtk_main_quit() in gtkwin.c to terminate the program, which is
conceptually wrong in this situation (we don't want to quit the whole
application when just one window closes) and also doesn't reliably
work anyway (GtkApplication doesn't seem to have a gtk_main invocation
in it at all, so those calls to gtk_main_quit produce a GTK assertion
failure message on standard error). Need to introduce a proper 'clean
up this struct gui_data' function (including finalising other stuff
dangling off it like the backend), call that, and delete just that one
window. (And then work out a replacement mechanism for having the
ordinary Unix-style gtkmain.c based programs terminate when their
session does.) connection_fatal() in particular should invoke this
mechanism, and terminate just the connection that had trouble.

Mouse wheel events and trackpad scrolling gestures don't work quite
right in the terminal drawing area.

There doesn't seem to be a resize handle on terminal windows. I don't
think this is a fundamental limitation of OS X GTK (their demo app has
one), so perhaps I need to do something to make sure it appears?

A slight oddity with menus that pop up directly under the mouse
pointer: mousing over the menu items doesn't highlight them initially,
but if I mouse off the menu and back on (without un-popping-it-up)
then suddenly that does work. I don't know if this is something I can
fix, though; it might very well be a quirk of the underlying GTK.

I want to arrange *some* way to paste efficiently using my Apple
wireless keyboard and trackpad. The trackpad doesn't provide a middle
button; I can't use the historic Shift-Ins shortcut because the
keyboard has no Ins key; I configure the Command key to be Meta, so
Command-V is off the table too. I can always use the menu, but I'd
prefer there to be _some_ easily reachable mouse or keyboard gesture.

Revamping the clipboard handling in general is going to be needed, as
well. Not everybody will want the current auto-copy-on-select
behaviour inherited from ordinary Unix PuTTY. Should arrange to have a
mode in which you have to take an explicit Copy action, and then
arrange that the Edit menu includes one of those.

Dialog boxes shouldn't be modal. I think this is a good policy change
in general, and the required infrastructure changes will benefit the
Windows front end too, but for a multi-session process it's even more
critical - you need to be able to type into one session window while
setting up the configuration for launching another. So everywhere we
currently run a sub-instance of gtk_main, or call any API function
that implicitly does that (like gtk_dialog_run), we should switch to
putting up the dialog box and going back to our ordinary main loop,
and whatever we were going to do after the dialog closed we should
remember to do it when that happens later on. Also then we can remove
the post_main() horror from gtkcomm.c.

The application menu bar is very minimal at the moment. Should include
all the usual stuff from the Ctrl-right-click menu - saved sessions,
mid-session special commands, Duplicate Session, Change Settings,
Event Log, clear scrollback, reset terminal, about box, anything else
I can think of.

Does OS X have a standard system of online help that I could tie into?

Need to work out what if anything we can do with Pageant on OS X.
Perhaps it's too much bother and we should just talk to the
system-provided SSH agent? Or perhaps not.

Nice-to-have: a custom right-click menu from the application's dock
tile, listing the saved sessions for quick launch. As far as I know
there's nothing built in to GtkApplication that can produce this, but
it's possible we might be able to drop a piece of native Cocoa code in
under ifdef, substituting an application delegate of our own which
forwards all methods we're not interested in to the GTK-provided one?

At the point where this becomes polished enough to publish pre-built,
I suppose I'll have to look into OS X code signing.
https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK%2B/OSX/Bundling has some links.
